The command for merging branches in Git is:

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

Here, `<branch-name>` is the name of the branch that you want to merge into your current branch. For example, if you're on the branch you want to merge changes into and you want to merge changes from a branch called "feature-branch," you would execute:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

This command will create a new commit that combines the changes from the specified branch into your current branch. If there are no conflicts, Git will perform an automatic merge. If there are conflicts, Git will mark the conflicted files, and you'll need to resolve the conflicts manually before finalizing the merge.

Remember to commit the merge after resolving any conflicts:

```bash
git commit -m "Merge branch 'feature-branch'"
```

This commit message is optional, but it's a good practice to provide a clear message describing the merge.

Undoing a rebase with staging can be a bit tricky because rebasing rewrites commit history. If you've completed a rebase and want to undo it while preserving the current state of your working directory, you can use the `reflog` and `reset` commands. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Identify the commit before the rebase:**
   - Run `git reflog` to see a list of recent actions, including the commit before the rebase.
   - Identify the commit hash corresponding to the state you want to revert to.

2. **Reset to the previous commit:**
   - Run the following command to reset your branch to the commit before the rebase:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard <commit-hash>
     ```
     Replace `<commit-hash>` with the hash you obtained from the `git reflog` command.

3. **Restore the branch to the remote state (if needed):**
   - If you've already pushed the changes from the rebased branch to a remote repository, you might need to force-push the branch to update the remote repository. Be cautious with force-push, especially if others are collaborating on the same branch.
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name> --force
     ```
     Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of your branch.

Keep in mind that this approach discards the changes introduced by the rebase, and it can potentially cause conflicts if the branch was shared with others. If you've pushed the rebased branch to a shared repository, coordinating with your collaborators is crucial to avoid disrupting their work.

Also, be cautious with `git reset --hard` and force-push, as they modify history and can result in data loss. If you're uncertain, consider creating a backup or consulting with your team before taking such actions.
